          Dr. Diaz-Calderon is the founder of Baby Formula Calc. She graduated from residency in Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, did her Fellowship at Childrenâ€™s National in Washington DC and is currently working as a pediatric gastroenterologist at University of Maryland.
With the goal of providing better care, she envisioned an app that would help pediatric healthcare providers in their daily consults. Dr. Diaz-Calderon focused her efforts on developing an app that could calculate baby formula preparations immediately. 
Deploying Baby Formula Calc lead to a hidden time savings all while improving the quality of care in her consults, now she was able to discuss with her patients how much calories they were getting, how to prepare the baby bottles, or how to fortify breastmilk, a calculation that could last 10-15 minutes would now be done in a couple of seconds. Baby Formula Calc is now being used at hospitals and practices across the nation saving hundreds of hours to health care providers and allowing them to improve the quality of their consults
